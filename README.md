Welcome 
=======

Great! We have invited you to participate in our test case validation process. 

We ask you to do this 

Why do we ask this



What:
-----



What to achieve: 
----------------

- Page should be intelligently split and structured into individual components
- Code should be annotated in English where needed


- Commit the code to a new Github repository
- Invite dannydewit to the Github repository for code review

- Deploy to Github Pages 

- Send us the url of the deployed app/site to us 



Requirements:
-------------

- React
- Bootstrap (optional)

- Assume access to data models via JSON API over Graphql
- Prepare the code with the required methods for data crud operations (we should only replace the urls and auth to make the frond-end work - this means you should define schema for required data)
- Add mock data for all data objects and test for little data, much data etc. So that the UI doesn't break. Paginate etc. if needed (mock.json etc.)
- Error tracking (no silent failing)
- Form Validation should be included
- Deliver each layout / page in clickable form (the app should be clickable using routes that will be used on production)
- Browser Support: All latest versions of mayor browsers
- Tests if possible
- i18n prepared

- Deploy the UI on Github Pages
